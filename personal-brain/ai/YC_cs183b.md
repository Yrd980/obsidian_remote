# How to Start a Startup

## Key Principles

- **Passion First, Startup Second**: Start with a specific passion, then build a startup around it.
- **Experience Breakdown**: 30% of experience is general knowledge.
- **Target Audience**: Designed for those aiming for hyper-growth and building a big company not suited for large corporations or those on their first startup.
- **Four Core Areas**: Idea, Product, Team, Execution.
- **Driven by a Specific Question**: The best startups begin by identifying a pressing question and realizing a startup is the best way to solve it.

## Idea

- **Good Idea > Pivoting**: Focus on finding a strong idea from the start rather than assuming you'll pivot.
- **Long-Term Thinking**: Consider market potential and mission orientation.
- **Startups Take Time**: Expect a 10-year journey.
- **Counter intuitive Ideas Win**: The best ideas often seem terrible at first—find a small market and quickly establish a monopoly.
- **Sharing Ideas is Safe**: Good ideas sound crazy, so there’s little competition or risk of theft.
- **Two Strengths for Students**:
  1. Market intuition
  2. Access to potential co-founders
- **Sequoia’s Key Question**: *Why now?*
- **Market Expansion vs. Scaling**: Prioritize expansion opportunities over premature scaling.
- **Clarity is Crucial**: Be able to explain your startup simply (e.g., "Google helps people find information online").

### 50 Cent’s Business Insight:
- Most people start with what they want to express, then find an audience.
- Do the opposite: begin with public demand, then create the appropriate supply.

## Product

- **Broad Definition**: Includes customer support, branding, and any interaction customers have with your product.
- **Process**: Idea → Product → Company.
- **Time Allocation**: How you spend your time reflects whether you're taking the startup seriously.
- **Two Core Jobs**:
  1. Build something users love.
  2. Talk to users.
- **Conservation of Law**: Aim to maximize the happiness your first product brings to the world.
- **Validation**: Growth should come from word-of-mouth or strong partnerships.
- **Sales & Marketing Matter**: Most startups fail because they don't make something users truly love.
- **Simplicity is Key**: Keep the product simple and focused.
- **Fanaticism in Founders**: The best founders are obsessive about their product.
- **Feedback Cycle**:
  1. Recruit early users manually (avoid ads at first).
  2. Gather feedback: What do users love? What would they pay for? What would make them recommend it?
  3. Iterate based on insights.
- **Build a Growth Engine**:
  - Show the product to users.
  - Collect and analyze feedback.
  - Make product decisions based on user insights.

### Key Metrics
- **Growth-Focused**: Prioritize metrics that drive sustainable growth.
- **Important Metrics**:
  - Total registrations
  - Active users
  - Engagement levels
  - Cohort retention
  - Revenue
  - Net Promoter Score (NPS)
