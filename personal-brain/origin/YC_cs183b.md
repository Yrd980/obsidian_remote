# how to start s startup

    specific passion is first then startup is second

30% experience is general
for whose goal is hyper-growth eventually to build big company and it's not fit for big company and non first startup
**four areas**: idea product team execution
driven by specific question then think startup is the best solution

## idea

good idea > pivot
long term thinking: market
mission oriented
derive not success
startup often takes for ten years
best ideas at first look like terrible: you should find small market then quick monopoly
you can share your idea because almost good ideas sounds crazy meaning less competition and not stealing
two strength for students: intuition for market then think new ideas and meet potential co-fonder
**Sequoia's question** why now?
considering market expansion not scaling
you should clear explain your startup like `google`
50 cent:

- Most people think first of what they want to express or make, then find the audience for their idea.
- You must work the opposite angle, thinking first of the public.
- You need to keep your focus on their changing needs, the trends that are washing through them. Beginning with their demand, you create the appropriate supply.

## product

broad product definition: it includes customer support and copyright explaining the product anything invovled in your customer's interaction with
what you build from them

process: idea -> product -> company
think time allocation which can judge whether you treat startup seriously
two jobs: build something users love , talk to users
build something that a small number of users love than a large number of users like
the law of conservation: how mach happiness you can put into the world with the first product of a startup
verify: you will get growth by word of mouth or a big partnership
sale and marketing are very important
    most die because they themselves fail to make something users love
simple is good
**fanatical** is key feature for founders
need feedback cycle method: recruit them(as mentioned small group) **by hand** rather ads
build a engine(live on growth):
- show it to users
- user feedback: what do they like? what would they pay for? what would make them recommend it?
- product decision
metrics: focus on growth
total registrations active users activity levels cohort retention revenue net promoter score
