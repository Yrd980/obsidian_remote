# notes:

## **Brightness**

### **Shutter Speed**
- The amount of time your camera sensor is exposed to the outside world while taking a picture.
- Affects:
  - **Motion blur** – Longer exposure time (slow shutter speed) results in motion blur.
  - **Freeze motion** – Shorter exposure time (fast shutter speed) captures sharp images of moving objects.
  - **Exposure time** – Longer exposure lets in more light; shorter exposure lets in less.

### **Aperture**
- Represents a “pupil” in your lens that can open and close to let in different amounts of light.
- Measured in **f-stops (f/1.4, f/2.8, f/5.6, etc.)**.
- Affects:
  - **Brightness** – A wider aperture (lower f-number) allows more light in; a smaller aperture (higher f-number) lets in less light.
  - **Depth of field** – A wider aperture (low f-number) creates a shallow depth of field (blurred background); a smaller aperture (high f-number) increases depth of field (everything in focus).

### **ISO**
- Similar to the sensitivity of film, but for digital sensors.
- Affects:
  - **Brightness** – Higher ISO values (e.g., ISO 1600) make the image brighter, while lower values (e.g., ISO 100) make it darker.
  - **Noise (grain)** – Higher ISO increases brightness but also introduces digital noise.

### **The Exposure Triangle**
- Shutter speed, aperture, and ISO work together to control brightness and exposure.
- Adjusting one setting often requires compensation with another to maintain proper exposure.
